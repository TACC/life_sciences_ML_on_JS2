Machine Learning for Life Sciences Research
===========================================

Welcome to an immersive dive into machine learning best practices and applications in life sciences.
This week-long, in-person workshop guides participants through machine learning fundamentals up to
cutting edge deep learning tools and methodologies for implementation in life sciences research.

Attendees will also gain hands-on experience utilizing TACC's high performance computing (HPC) systems,
learn effective techniques to prepare and manage preprocessing of datasets, and learn how to build and
train their own models efficiently and accurately.
