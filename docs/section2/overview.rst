Hands-on Machine Learning
=========================

In this unit we introduce the field of Machine Learning (ML) and develop the first set of techniques
for supervised learning. We will explore key ML concepts, including supervised classification,
linear regression, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and decision trees, with a focus on ML
considerations and evaluation in life science applications.
