ACCESS
------


- ACCESS
- Jetstream2 resources are obtained through ACCESS. ACCESS is a programestablished and funded by the NSF to help researchers and educators utilize advanced computing systems and services. Jetstream2 is but one of many resources made available through ACCESS, which standardizes the process of acquiring time with these resources through allocations of ACCESS credits. Applying for an allocation is like applying for a small grant.

ACCESS Workflow
---------------


- ACCESS Workflow
- Create your ACCESS ID.PIs and end users both require an ACCESS ID - PIs to request and manage their allocation, users to login to resources.
- Select your project type based on your needs.In ascending order of size: Explore, Discover, Accelerate, and Maximize.
- Prepare and submit your allocation request.Requirements for a request increase along with allocation size, but Explore requests need little more than a project title and abstract.
- Receive and exchange your ACCESS credits.Once awarded, ACCESS credits are resource-neutral until they are applied toward specific computing resources.

- 1 ACCESS credit = 1 GB Storage
- Jetstream2 Usage Estimation Calculator
